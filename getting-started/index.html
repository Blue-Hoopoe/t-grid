                <h3>Why and when use t-grid?</h3>
            </header>
            <div class="large-text-justify">
                <p>I have created the t-grid as a result of <span class="attr-val">compromise between old browsers support and responsive design</span>. I
                    was definitely tired of worrying about how Internet Explorer would render my flex-box grid and how could
                    I fix this.</p>
                <p>Fortunately for me and you, there is one display property that we can use for our advantage: tables. They sometimes
                    can behave like a flexboxes and they can be a little bit more adjustable then standard divs.</p>
                <p>I truly believe that t-grid can be a nice consensus between design and usability in some cases. Just be sure that you know its potential and its wrinkles. <span class="accent">It is not suitable for all situations.</span> Hovewer, it is still worth considering.</p>

            <div class="medium-text-justify">
                <p>Below I present you some of my favorite advantages of using t-grid:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tables are really widely supported.</li>
                    <li>Because of a sass source you can easly customize your grid.</li>
                    <li>You can create contained, nested tables.</li>
                    <li>In contrast to standard floated grid, columns can automatically shrink depending on their content.</li>
                    <li>They are perfect for filled grid layouts with no extra space beetwen.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But there are two sides to every story:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rows can't be wrapped as long as they are displaying as a table.</li>
                    <li>You can face some padding/margin problems.</li>
                    <li>Nested tables can lead to some unwanted effects, so it's recommended to mix table and float grids.</li>
                    <li>To create nested tables you must provide jQuery.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>I have created for you a tutorial in this very folder which includes five lessons to help you begin. </p>
                    <p>To get started, you just need to have overall concept how float grids work, because t-grid is very similar. In t-grid there are by default five breakpoints to use and twelve columns to your service:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="tag">xxs</span> - 360px,</li>
                        <li><span class="json">xs</span> - 576px,</li>
                        <li><span class="attr-val">sm</span> - 768px,</li>
                        <li><span class="attr">md</span> - 992px,</li>
                        <li><span class="js">lg</span> - 1200px.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The great thing is that you can easily adapt this numbers for your needs! Just change some variables in <span class="accent">source/sass/_variables.scss</span> file and compile the grid.</p>
